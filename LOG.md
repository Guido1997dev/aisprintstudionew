# Project Log - AI Sprint Studio

## 2025-12-07: Homepage Improvements - Pre-Implementation

### Context
Analyzing and improving the home page to make it more concrete and conversion-focused.

### Problems Identified
1. **Lack of social proof** - No testimonials, client logos, or concrete results
2. **Vague value proposition** - Not clear what exactly we build
3. **No clear CTA for lead generation** - Missing a low-barrier entry point
4. **Hero copy could be stronger** - Current copy is safe but not compelling
5. **Missing concrete use cases** - Features listed but not tangible examples

### Planned Changes (Must Have)

#### STAP 1: Backup & Commit ✅
- Committing current version before making changes
- Creating this LOG.md to track progress

#### STAP 2: Hero Section Improvement
- New hero copy: "Stop met praten over AI. Start met bouwen."
- Updated subheading: More concrete, mentions 1-4 weeks timeline
- Purpose: Stronger, more direct messaging that stands out

#### STAP 3: Gratis AI Quick Scan CTA
- New prominent section after hero
- Form with: Naam, Email, Bedrijfswebsite, Optional textarea for challenge
- Value prop: Get 3-5 AI automation opportunities for your business within 48 hours
- No obligations, no sales pitch
- Backend: API endpoint + Supabase storage
- Purpose: Low-barrier lead generation, demonstrate expertise upfront

#### STAP 4: Statistics Bar
- Add after hero section
- Show: 50+ Sprints, 25+ Klanten, 300+ Workflows, 95% Tevredenheid
- Purpose: Build credibility with concrete numbers

#### STAP 5: "Wat We Bouwen" - Concrete Use Cases (Discuss UI first)
- 6-8 concrete examples of what we build
- Each with: Icon, Title, Description, Example result, Duration, Tech stack
- Examples: Document Processing, AI Chatbot, Email Automation, etc.
- Purpose: Make it crystal clear what we deliver

#### STAP 6: Social Proof
- Testimonials section with quotes from happy clients
- Client logo wall
- Purpose: Trust building

#### STAP 7+: Polish
- Expand FAQ
- Add trust badges
- Mobile testing

### Lessons Learned
- **Before**: Homepage was too vague about what we actually deliver
- **Strategy**: Be extremely concrete - show exactly what we build, in what timeframe, with what results
- **Differentiation**: Other agencies are vague; we'll be crystal clear
- **Lead gen**: Free Quick Scan = value upfront, no commitment, builds trust

### Next Steps
1. Commit current version (backup)
2. Implement Stap 2-3
3. Discuss UI for use cases section before implementing Stap 4
